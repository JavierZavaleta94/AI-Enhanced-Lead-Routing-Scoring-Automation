# AI-Enhanced Lead Routing & Scoring Automation

**Make.com, HubSpot CRM, AI Prompting, Google Sheets, Slack, Outlook**

## Project Summary

This project automates the go-to-market lead routing process using AI.  
Inbound HubSpot form submissions are analyzed via an AI prompt to generate lead scores, qualification status, next actions, AI confidence, and insight summaries.  
Qualified leads are updated in HubSpot, logged in Google Sheets, trigger email notifications, and high-priority leads notify the owner via Slack for faster follow-up.
